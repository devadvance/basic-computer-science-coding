# Basic Computer Science Coding

Repo of the projects I did as a Computer Science student at the University of Pittsburgh.

## Description

This is a repo containing nearly all of the projects I did as a Computer Science student at the University of Pittsburgh. Many of these projects covered fundamental topics that are critical for any coder, so I wanted to provide them as examples and possible starting points for any project.

They are (generally) written in Java or C, and may be complete programs, or merely code snippets.

Note: I have moved this repo from Google Code on 2015-09-03, as Google Code is shutting down. This repo was originally hosted [here](https://code.google.com/p/basic-computer-science-coding/).
